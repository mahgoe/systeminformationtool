# System Information Tool
by https://github.com/mahgoe

# Description
This program, designed with a user-friendly menu interface, fetches and displays crucial information about the local machine. Initially, the program displays a main menu, where the user can select the type of information they wish to view. Once a selection is made, the corresponding data is displayed in the console.
Following this, an export menu is presented, allowing the user to decide if they want to export the obtained information to a CSV file. If chosen, these CSV files are saved in a directory named "SITEXPORT", located in the user's local folder on their machine.
An important feature of the program is the implementation of -UseCulture. This ensures that the formatting and presentation of the data in the CSV file matches the cultural settings of the current machine, providing an optimized experience for international users.
To exit the main menu, the user can simply input "q".
Furthermore, each instance of the program's usage is meticulously logged for future reference and troubleshooting. These logs are stored in the "SITEXPORT" folder, providing a comprehensive historical record of user interactions.

This program offers a combination of immediate access to essential system information and seamless export capabilities, while promoting user-friendly interaction and providing detailed activity logs.

### Notes
At the current state of this program, the full program is in the language German. A language selection is in planning.
The next step of this program is to track the user for the logfiles.

# Usage
You can use this tool for monitoring your system

I'm a newbie developer. This system information tool is my first ever PowerShell script. It was a exam in my training and I kept working on it.
